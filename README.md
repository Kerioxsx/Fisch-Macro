# Fisch-Macro


ðŸŽ£ Fisch Automated Fishing System
Fisch Automated Fishing System is an advanced automation utility engineered for the Roblox experience Fisch.
It is designed to fully replicate player fishing actions with precision timing, adaptive control logic, and rod-specific optimizations.
The system uses pixel recognition, color tolerance scanning, and configurable multipliers to handle every fishing mechanic in-game without manual intervention.

ðŸ“Œ Core Functionality
Automated Casting
Dynamically controls rod casting duration and timing to ensure optimal throw distance per rod configuration.

Bobber Event Detection
Monitors splash events through pixel scanning, initiating reeling with minimal latency.

Shake Minigame Automation
Executes the shake sequence via click-based inputs, with fail-safe navigation logic.
Automatically bypassed for rods whose Lure Speed is high enough to skip shake events entirely.

Catch Bar Minigame Control
Keeps the fish icon within the catch bar by calculating real-time movement speed using stability multipliers and division factors.

Rod-Specific Profiles
Includes structured configuration blocks for every rod in the game, each tailored to that rodâ€™s base stats and any enchantment-derived performance modifiers.

Enchantment Integration
Adjusts timing, stability control, and tolerances based on known enchantment buffs such as:

Lure Speed Increase

Catch Bar Stability

Arrow Speed Adjustment

Fail-Safe Recovery
Automatically restarts the sequence if no valid event is detected within the configured delay window.
